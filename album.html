        <li>We wanted to give a little something back as a token of our appreciation. Inside your gift bag, you’ll find: </li>
        <li>🍪 **Homemade Oatmeal Cookies** – A special thank you to Lisa for baking these delicious treats with her secret recipe! </li> 
        <li> 🏮 **Handpainted Coaster – You may have noticed a special symbol on our invitation and decorations. This is the Chinese character 囍 (Xi), which represents **double happiness**, a traditional blessing for weddings. We incorporated our initials **C & J** and our wedding date **1.11** into the design, making it uniquely ours.</li>
    </ul>
