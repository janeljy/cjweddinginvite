        <li> We wanted to give a little something back as a token of our appreciation. Inside your gift bag, you’ll find: </li>
        <li> 🍪 Homemade <strong>Oatmeal Cookies</strong> – A special thank you to Lisa for baking these delicious treats with her secret recipe! </li> 
        <li> 🏮 Handpainted <strong>Coaster</strong> – You may have noticed a special symbol on our invitation and decorations. This is the Chinese character 囍 (Xi), which represents <strong>double happiness</strong>, a traditional blessing for weddings. We incorporated our initials <strong>C & J</strong> and our wedding date <strong>1.11</strong> into the design, making it uniquely ours.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul> Thank you again for being a part of our celebration! 💕 </ul>
